Wiki
======
Wiki allows users to collaborate in the creation of content while providing professors with detailed analytics. Options for:
0. Comments
0. "Like" a post to crowd source approval of posts
0. Versions: all posts can be edited by anyone and create a new version or can only be edited by the author and change the original post.
0. Anonymous posts
0. Subscribe to receive all email of all new posts.
0. New comment will automatically send email to the original poster or other commentors, regardless of whether they are subscribed or not.

When a Wiki app is added to a course, it will appear as a menu item in the left Course navigation. You can have multiple Tuck Wiki apps per course as long as each wiki has a different Name (see step #5 below).

## Admin
Delete Student Posts: Click this button to delete all student posts to the wiki while retaining all posts made by professors, TAs or others with administrative access. Confirmation is asked for prior to deletion.

Page Ordering: By default, pages are ordered alpha-numerically. Changing the page order number (default = 0) will take precedence over the page name ordering in descending order. Changes are automatically saved.

Page Names: Just change the name of the page in the text input box.

Section Names: Select the page in the main wiki tab first. Then click the Admin tab to change any section names.

Delete Page: Click the trash can next to a page to delete a page, all sections, and all posts and comments. Confirmation is asked for prior to deletion.

Wiki Name: This is the name that must match the name entered in the Canvas Settings Add App section. You can change the wiki name, but the name needs to be changed in both locations to keep any previous wiki content.

Use Versions: Allow any post to be edited as a new version, with all previous versions saved and viewable.

Allow Likes: Allow students to upvote a post.
